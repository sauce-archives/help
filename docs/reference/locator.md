<h3 id="waitLoaded">waitLoaded( [timeout] )</h3>
<p>wait until no major visual updates are recognized on the screen, continuous after timeout</p>
<p><ul>
	<li>
		<strong>timeout</strong>

In some cases an application requires some time to update the screen between actions. For example, when a user needs to login he first needs to click on the "Login" button, then type in his credentials and press the "Confirm" button. If an application takes some time to load the login form, then the system might start typing the credentials when the screen is not ready yet. *waitLoaded* ensures that the screen is ready before the next action is performed. If the screen still changes, the next action will not be performed until there are no more updates except for really small ones to ignore blinking cursors. If an application screen is supposed to change all the time because of an animation, the timeout can be decreased.

When to use *waitLoaded*:

- The system starts typing before text field has appeared on the screen.  
- Normally the system clicks on the button as soon as it finds it on the screen. In some cases all elements on the screen have to be loaded beforehand.

Usually, *waitLoaded* steps are inserted during recording when the system detects that an action was followed by a lot of screen changes. The loading speed of web applications can vary from execution to execution so that in some cases *waitLoaded* might not be inserted automatically. The page may have loaded fastly during recording but loads slowly in some of the replays. In this case *waitLoaded* should be inserted manually.
